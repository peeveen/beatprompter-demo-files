I'm really close to[Am]night
[C]And I feel like I'm [Bm]moving inside her[E]
Lying in the [Am]dark
[C]I think that I'm be[Bm]ginning to know her[E]
Let it [Am]go [C]
I'll be there when you[F] call

Whenever I {soh}[C]fall
[G]at your [Am]feet{eoh}
[F]And you let your {soh}[C]tears
[G]rain down [Am]on me{eoh}
[F]Whenever I {soh}[C]touch
[G]your slow turning [Am]pain{eoh}

[F]You're hiding from me [Am]now
[C]There's something in the [Bm]way that you're talking[E]
The words don't [Am]sound right
[C]But I hear them all [Bm]{soh:#00ff00}moving in[E]side you
,,,[Am]Know, [C]I'll{eoh} be waiting when you [F]call

Whenever I {soh}[C]fall
[G]at your [Am]feet{eoh}
[F]And you let your {soh}[C]tears
[G]rain down [Am]on me{eoh}
[F]Whenever I {soh}[C]touch
[G]your slow turning [Am]pain{eoh}

,[F]The finger of
{soh}[C]blame has turned up[G]on itself and Iâ€™m
[Am]More than willing to [F]offer myself, do you
[C]Want my presence or [G]need my help?{eoh}
[Am]Who knows where that might [F]lead?
{b:4}And I {soh}[C]fall{eoh}[G][Am] [F]
{b:4}And I {soh}[C]fall{eoh}[G][Am] [F]

,Whenever I {soh}[C]fall
[G]at your [Am]feet{eoh}
