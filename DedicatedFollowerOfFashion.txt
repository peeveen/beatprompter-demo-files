They seek him [G7]here, they seek him [C]there,
His clothes are [G7]loud, but never [C]square.[C7]
[F]It will make or break him so he's [C]got to [C/B]buy the [A7]best,
'Cause he's a [Dm7]dedicated [G7]follower of [C]fashion.

And when he [G7]does his little [C]rounds,
'Round the [G7]boutiques of London [C]Town,[C7]
[F]Eagerly pursuing all the [C]latest [C/B]fads and [A7]trends,
'Cause he's a [Dm7]dedicated [G7]follower of [C]fashion.

,Oh yes he [G7]is (oh yes he is)
,Oh yes he [C]is (oh yes he is)

He [F]thinks he is a flower to be [C]looked at,
And [F]when he pulls his frilly nylon [C]panties [C/B]right up [A7]tight,
He feels a [Dm7]dedicated [G7]follower of [C]fashion.

,Oh yes he [G7]is (oh yes he is)
,Oh yes he [C]is (oh yes he is)

There's [F]one thing that he loves and that is [C]flattery.
[F]One week he's in polka-dots, the [C]next week [C/B]heâ€™s in [A7]stripes.
'Cause he's a [Dm7]dedicated [G7]follower of [C]fashion.

They seek him [G7]here, they seek him [C]there,
In Regent [G7]Street and Leicester [C]Square.[C7]
[F]Everywhere the Carnabetian [C]army [C/B]marches [A7]on,
Each one an [Dm7]dedicated [G7]follower of [C]fashion.

,Oh yes he [G7]is (oh yes he is)
,Oh yes he [C]is (oh yes he is)

His [F]world is built 'round discotheques and [C]parties.
This [F]pleasure-seeking individual [C]always [C/B]looks his [A7]best
'Cause he's a [Dm7]dedicated [G7]follower of [C]fashion.

,Oh yes he [G7]is (oh yes he is)
,Oh yes he [C]is (oh yes he is)

He [F]flits from shop to shop just like a [C]butterfly.
In [F]matters of the cloth he is as [C]fickle [C/B]as can [A7]be,
'Cause he's a [Dm7]dedicated [G7]follower of [C]fashion.[C/B][A7]
He's a [Dm7]dedicated [G7]follower of [C]fashion.[C/B][A7]
,He's a [Dm7]dedicated [G7]follower of [C]fashion.
