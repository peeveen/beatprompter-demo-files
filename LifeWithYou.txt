{b:2}[C]
[C]When I was a younger [F]man
[C]When I was a silly [F]boy
,,[C]I didn't [F]need a thing, I
,,[C]Was strong as [F]anything, I
[Dm7]Viewed solitude as a [G7]joy

[C]But since I met you I'm distr[F]aught
[C]You wandered in and now I'm [F]caught
,,[C]I never [F]thought I would see
,,[C]Someone so [F]truly good, some-
[Dm7]One who's so everything I'm [G7]not

[C]I want to spend my life with [F]you[G]
[C]Don't want to live all al[F]one[G]
,,[C]I can't conc[Em]eive of the
,,[F]Years left to [Am7]me
[F]Without [G]you[STOP] in our home

[C]But what if, what if, what if, [F]what
[C]If it's not perfect then it's [F]not
,,[C]But every [F]care Iâ€™ll take
,,[C]Nothing I [F]won't forsake
[Dm7]To dwell beside what you've [G7]got

,,[F]Every time I think a[C]bout you
,,I think I can't live with[Am]out you
,,I tell you something: I am
{b:3}[G7]Nothing without you

[C]I want to spend my life with [F]you[G]
[C]Don't want to live all al[F]one[G]
,,[C]I can't conc[Em]eive of the
,,,{soh:#00ff00}[F]Years left to [Am7]me{eoh}
[F]Without [G]you in our [C]home[G][C]

[C]I want to spend my life with [F]you[G]
[C]Don't want to live all al[F]one[G]
,,[C]I can't conc[Em]eive of the
,,[F]Years left to [Am7]me
[F]Without [G]you[STOP] in our [C]home
[F]Without [G]you in our [C]home
