# BeatPrompter Demo Files

These are some demo files that you can use with [BeatPrompter](https://github.com/peeveen/beatprompter).
I use these in my own performances; they are not necessarily in the same key as the original songs.
Highlighted text shows where backing vocals or harmonies should sing along.

## Usage

Download these files and import them into your cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive).
For Google Drive, you can import the text files as Google Docs files.

The text files contain the lyrics and chords of some hit songs, arranged for BeatPrompter to use with appropriate timing tags.
The audio files are percussion backing tracks that I either created in FL Studio, or compiled using preset rhythms from drum machines.

If anyone has any complaints about copyright infringement, [contact me](mailto:steven.fullhouse@gmail.com) and I will remove the offending files.

Have fun!
